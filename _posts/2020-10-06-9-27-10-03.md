## Intro
Welcome to the first edition of Iraq News Roundup. I’m Peixian, and I’m joined by Zaki, and we’ll quickly run through the major news of Iraq in the past week.

## Covid Stats in Iraq
The current covid situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate. On October 2nd, the Iraqi Health ministry reports [4,700 new infections](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/latest-on-coronavirus-outbreak/iraq-reports-over-4-700-more-virus-cases-67-deaths/1993614), which brings the total number of infections to 372,259, with a total death rate of up to 9,298. As of October 3rd, Al-Sumeria and [Shafaaq news reported that flights have been halted due to Covid](https://www.iraq-businessnews.com/2020/10/03/turkey-suspends-flights-with-iraq/)

The increasing cases come as doctors are [experiencing violence from the families of covid patients](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-iraq-healthcare-idUSKCN26E1SR). The Iraqi Medical Association states that there have been occurences of physical altercation against doctors from grieving families, and the Iraqi government has vowed action.

Covid still doesn’t seem to have halted the beginning of Arbaeen, however. [AFP reports](https://www.barrons.com/news/pilgrims-flood-iraq-s-karbala-for-arbaeen-despite-virus-fears-01601819106) “tens of thousands of pilgrims” marking the start of arbaeen, with only very few abiding by masks and social distancing rules. However with borders shuttered, the marches this year are proceeding without millions of pilgrims from abroad.

## Headline News
The headlines news of this week is [Pompeo threatening to close the US embassy in Iraq](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/politics/pompeo-embassy-baghdad-iraq.html). Of course, this has set off a wave of think pieces, possibly portending a change in US policy.

The important matters on the ground are that, a day after the news broke, [rockets were launched at the Erbil International Airport](https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/rockets-land-in-erbil-hours-after-iraqi-pm-pledges-to-protect-diplomats). Reuters reports six rockets were launched, with [AP reporting that six rockets were intercepted](https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/6-missiles-intercepted-targeting-airport-in-northern-iraq/1946463) at 8:30pm. However, given the difficulties of missile interception and the darkness of night, these reports should be taken with a grain of salt. However, what is probably accurate is that there were no fatalities.

According to AP, the rockets were fired from a pickup truck near Bartella, south of Erbil, a region managed by Brigade 30 of the PMF, a largely Shabak group. [@TomTheBasedCat disagrees with this](https://twitter.com/TomtheBasedCat/status/1311750286239821831), although the OSINT from this time is difficult to verify. What does make sense is that Brigade 30 antagonizing the KRG has little visible benefit at the moment. Erbil, the most populous city of the Kurdistan region of Iraq, is considered a safer harbor than Baghdad for American businesses and diplomats. In that light, the recent attacks may be a signal of restlessness by the militia if not their Iranian backers.



## Oil News
In oil news, Japanese plant builder JGC Corp signed a deal worth $3.8 bil USD with the South Iraq Oil company to help build a refinery complex. Reito Kaneko in Tokyo reports that this is one of the largest oil projects by JGC, and will last until 2025, employing over 7,000 local workers and creating around 2,000 operating jobs.

OPEC+ cuts have hit hard. Ihsan Abdul Jabbar, the Oil Minister, states that the September cuts, with amount to 203,000 barrels a day for September, were fully complied with. However, he did state that he was worried about the market, especially due to Covid-19 concerns.

## Others

On September 20th, not-for-profit press monitoring organisation Middle East Monitor reported that the recent treasure trove of bank documents leaked by Buzzfeed News. The documents reveal nearly four billion dollars worth of suspicious money transfers between Deutsche Bank and Bank America and a number of Iraqi bank branches overrun by the Islamic State over the 1 year period of 15 June 2014 and 30 June 2015. The largest of the transfers were overseen by the Trade Bank of Iraq, which has come under repeated scrutiny after rounds of corruption probes and allegations. While Iraq is no stranger to embezzlement (and in fact continues to rank at the bottom of Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index), this report sheds light on the depth of involvement of among the most trusted financial institutions in the world.

Early Elections - Will it be enough?
As the one accepted grounds for public mediation, the Iraqi parliamentary elections establish the mandate for the new government and set the tone for the nation’s disparate political, ethnic, and religious groups. For that reason, we will be tracking news and discussion on the matter until poll workers count the last ballot.

In 2018, the parliamentary election demonstrated a victory for a pluralistic Islamic society. Yet, unfulfilled promises to provide basic services - electricity, clean water, jobs - drove thousands to the streets in protest in late 2019.

Last month, Sistani stepped to support activists’ demand for early parliamentary elections in 2021. Since then, a number of observers have already jumped in to declare the accelerated election timeline as a pointless affair. In a recent op-ed published in Al-Jazeera, Hayder Al-Shakeri argues that the elections have been and continue to be a distraction from the need to confront the muhasasa system that dominates Iraqi political life. If electoral showmanship continues to trample over meaningful reform, he portends “what comes next may be much bloodier than the October Revolution.”

Indeed, posters plastered all over Baghdad with the writing “October is a time for revolutions” remind me that I have kept the figure of last year’s demonstrations keen on the minds of Iraqis throughout the capital. On Thursday, mourners returned to Tahrir Square to commemorate the loss of over 550 lives in the previous year. A year squandered by the pandemic and record heat, the elections loom over the horizon as their next opportunity to inaugurate a new future for Iraq.
