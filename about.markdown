A blog about Iraq, with news roundups, books, and papers. The name is from Abu Nawa's "How Lovely is a Karkh Bar":

```
May the day never come that God destroys Karkh
Nor Susa’s convivial parlours
How lovely is a Karkh bar, that gathers us
Where we follow, with drinks, Lucifer
Radiant wine, red, crystal-clear
Aged in Karkh by Qadoos, its vintner
Of different faith, with grey hair locks
Greeted both by rabbi and minister
Once the wine turns clear, he lets flow
A red draught, driving off displeasure
Brought by one with two fine, bright cheeks
Matching the Queen of Sheba’s splendour
Dressed in kurta, and Khorasani clothes
By God, none’s like him in Toos, nor Merv
```
